Currently support HK PRC and Mainland China, but your can easily expand it to other regions. Just replace with region only models and URLs. 

This project is a simple tool to check for iPhone 7 & 7 Plus stock availability using Apple's JSON API. I will not garantee the stability of this method. Use it at your own risks. Both work under iPad or iPhone. 

Please use [sideload](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-sideload-apps-on-iphone-and-ipad/) method to install it on your devices. 

Anyway, just 2.5 hrs of work, enjoy!
